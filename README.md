# CppND-Garbage-Collector

Implement own version of a smart pointer. we can think of this as implementing our own garbage collector, to use a concept from other programming languages. Building this project will help  understand both how to work with pointers and references, and also why smart pointers are so important to modern C++ programming. After Completing the implementations and verify our implementation does not have any memory leaks!
